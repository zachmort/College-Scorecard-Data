<!-- Describe your project in brief -->
Data download link: https://data.ed.gov/dataset/college-scorecard-all-data-files-through-6-2020/resources?resource=823ac095-bdfc-41b0-b508-4e8fc3110082

Being a recent graduate from college, this dataset from CollegeScoreCard intrigued me! There is a TON of information about each of the 6,694 colleges in the dataset. I could analyze this dataset for weeks, with over 2,900 variables the questions I could look into are endless. Some of the questions I did look into are:
- Revenue per student based on the type of instiution (Private, Public, Private non-for-profit)
- Total debt for all schools (also total debt based on state)
- Avg income after graduation per school
- Diversity of programs (# of programs)
- % difference of instate vs out of state tuition in each state
- Debt per race class
- First gen vs non first gen college student completion rates
